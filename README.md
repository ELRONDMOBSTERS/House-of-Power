# House-of-Power
House of Power (HOP) is a universe powered by digital assets that engage and empower users through digital ownership and economic activity. A blockchain-based trading card game is at the center of this universe, where players battle with wacky and quirky cards. The humorous nature of the cards is very much a reflection of the loose and fun nature of the Elrond Mobsters universe. It is a place that aims to offer an immersive in-game environment that transcends gaming. The game is built with Unity and uses Elrond technology to allow players to own in-game Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Hop Tokens ($HOP) that are usable and functional within the gaming framework. These digital assets give their owners the power to earn further rewards, distributed by automated systems that hold real-world value. Alternatively, the assets can be sold in NFT marketplaces.
