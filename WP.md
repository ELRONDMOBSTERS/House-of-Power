# House-of-Power

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

House of Power (HOP) is a universe powered by digital assets that engage and empower users through digital ownership and economic activity. A blockchain-based trading card game is at the center of this universe, where players battle with wacky and quirky cards. The humorous nature of the cards is very much a reflection of the loose and fun nature of the Elrond Mobsters universe. It is a place that aims to offer an immersive in-game environment that transcends gaming. The game is built with Unity and uses Elrond technology to allow players to own in-game Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Hop Tokens ($HOP) that are usable and functional within the gaming framework. These digital assets give their owners the power to earn further rewards, distributed by automated systems that hold real-world value. Alternatively, the assets can be sold in NFT marketplaces.
All players can access the play-to-earn aspect of the game, but owning and bringing into play a digital identity in the form of a Mobster NFT guarantees superior $HOP token rewards and access to premium features. Mobsters are characters that reign the Cities of the World and represent the primary digital asset layer. They battle each other using non-NFT and NFT based cards, which serve as the second digital asset layer. NFT-based cards are rarer, more desirable, and are essential to creating powerful decks. $HOP token is the in-game currency that fuels the game economy and serves as the platform utility. Players can earn $HOP by simply playing the game or leasing their Mobsters NFT to other players and sharing their game rewards. 
Users can choose to use $HOP or $EGLD, the native cryptocurrency of the Elrond blockchain, to purchase card packs, craft new NFT cards, in-game purchase add-ons, and enter into lease agreements with Mobsters NFT holders to experience the gaming world more affordably. However, using $HOP as a payment method will guarantee a discounted price. The above features are built on the Elrond Blockchain that offers almost zero gas fees, instant trades, and scalability, which are all important to creating a seamless and accessible gaming experience. Additionally, users may opt to stake their $HOP in the staking protocol and receive additional tokens as a reward for stabilizing the economy.

INTRODUCT THE PROJECT

HOUSE OF POWER is a virtual world where players can own Mobsters and use them to engage in strategic battles with a carefully crafted deck of cards. It is a place where players can choose to join either the Italians, the Russians, the Colombians, the Japanese, the Irish or the Special Drop faction and find the Mobster that is right for them as they navigate through the challenges presented by the elements on the battlefield. Earn $HOP rewards for winning battles, or stake the tokens for further rewards and have a say in the future of the HOP gaming world. The game economy set up by HOP will feature an autonomous rewards pool structure to enable individual transactions without oversight.
This paper will explore the conceptual underpinnings of the HOP economic ecosystem and outline how the $HOP token will interact with the world’s services, characters, and items (NFTs). The goal is for the reader to be introduced to the various DeFi mechanisms and methodologies used to bridge the NFT layer through $HOP. The token itself is designed for in-game mechanics, and thus, the underlying fact is that 1 $HOP = 1 $HOP, always. 

BEING PART OF THE GAME

The game uses Elrond technology to provide unique mechanics that allow players to be part of the game beyond the traditional and flawed playing models existing in the gaming industry. Players can have real ownership and full control of in-game digital assets, such as Mobster Characters, Mobster Cards, Perks Upgrades and items used for customization purposes. Player empowerment doesn’t stop here, as players can also take direct ownership of the game through a revenue-sharing model facilitated by token staking with an automated rewards system. A sustainable economic environment is created by flipping the power structure, taking control away from the publishers, and allowing players to drive and dictate the game’s direction. This model promotes interaction and engagement and ultimately incentivizes users to participate actively in the gameplay and economy.

INTEGRATING FUNCTIONAL NFTS INTO GAMEPLAY

Digital assets such as Mob Characters, Mob Cards, and customization items are an essential and integral part of the game itself. Such assets are a prerequisite to playing the game and being part of the community, players can evolve and grow with the game using the NFT enhancements that increase their engagement and advance their playing level. 

1. The mobsters Characters

The HOP universe is controlled by characters called Mobsters. Depending on how many Mobsters you own differentiates the player during battles, guarantees  superior play-to-earn rewards, and gives access to Mobsters Perks 

2. The mobsters Perks

The Mob Characters, also known as Mob Avatars, are only visually presented as a half body piece. Players can create their ideal style in the game by customizing the body of their avatar through a second NFT called Mob Perk. Each body enhancement also carries a unique in-game animation, such as a finishing move or dance. The winning player’s character triggers the animation at the end of the battle.

3. The Mobsters Cards

All players get access to a free base card pool that is not considered a digital asset. It allows players to play the game, understand it, and decide if they wish to enhance their card deck to be more competitive. NFT-based Mobsters Cards are more desirable and powerful, enhance battle strategies, and add the important functional aspect of ownership into the gameplay.

ENABLING USER GROWTH

The ownership of Mobsters NFTs unlocks full economic access to the game, but there are alternatives for potential players to enter the game world more affordably. New players can either lease a Mobster NFT or even play the game without any NFTs. For the latter, a user can launch the game and access a pool of default, free non-NFT playing cards. They can now battle any player and become eligible to claim $HOP for in-game upgrades or new cards. Although this free path to the game is there to be used, the $HOP rewards earned from battles will be a fraction of what Mobster NFT owners generate. An alternative is thus offered to players to lease Mobsters from other players and, in turn, satisfy that requirement and earn the maximum token rewards. These alternative access paths enable user growth while protecting Mobsters NFT holders’ benefits.

SCALING THE ECOSYSTEM WITH ELROND

Elrond Blockchain (EGLD) is a scaling solution that allows players to grow within the HOP ecosystem by significantly decreasing transactional fees incurred during the buying and selling of NFTs. Deploying HOP assets onto ELROND ensures that it is affordable for any user to engage in a digital transaction without worrying about high transactional costs associated like others blockchain. This move to a gasless or free-trade system will create higher activity levels for deck building and buying cards on the buying and selling markets. User engagement is highly valuable to create a sustainable ecosystem. Using this blockchain will create a foundation through which high participation rates on the market can be created and bring more economic opportunities for new players and traders. Combined with speed and affordability, this model solves a layered solution for deployment at a mass level to facilitate mass adoption of the HOP ecosystem. 

MONETARY POLICY

The $HOP token is the governance and rewards token of the HOUSE OF POWER universe. $EGLD is added to the ecosystem as another currency to acquire in-game assets and pay for in-game activities and other necessary game functions. The value of $HOP will come from the sustainability and expansion of the game economy.

$HOP has a fixed supply of 750,000,000 tokens, which will be allocated as follows:

PLAY-TO-EARN REWARDS
The play-to-earn rewards pool is the key driver of the game economy and so is assigned the largest distribution allocation of 225,000,000 tokens. The gaming rewards attract players to join the ecosystem and incentivize them to play an active role by playing the game, trading digital assets, and participating in various gaming activities that support the economy. Rewards from the pool will be distributed to the players through regular daily rewards, tournaments, special events, and missions. These rewards are based on an autonomous system where the HOP team has no control of the distribution of tokens.

STAKING REWARDS POOLS
138,750,000 tokens are allocated into two staking reward pools to be later distributed between the stakers of $HOP tokens and MOBSTERS NFTs. 112,500,000 tokens will be channeled into the staking pool that rewards $HOP stakers. This initial pool contribution will kickstart the staking protocol rewards before the economy fully functions with self-sustaining gaming related inflows.
The remaining 26,250,000 tokens are put into the staking pool that rewards NFT stakers. NFT stakers are defined as anyone who simply has not listed their digital assets on 3rd party marketplaces. This allows MOB owners to earn $HOP tokens on their NFT before game release. 
In both cases, the distribution of tokens will be controlled through a reward-based exponential decay strategy that rewards early contributors with a higher emission rate. The distribution of tokens is done through an automated system without any influence from the HOP team.

ECOSYSTEM

A large part of the House of  Power metaverse, is the community members, NFT owners, game players, fans, investors, and creators. 123,750,000 tokens are allocated to this pool to initiate, facilitate, and support community engagement to deepen and strengthen the relationship and trust between HOP and the community. The tokens will be used for community tournament rewards, design contests, referrals, growth projects, and increasing the governance and engagement of the community.

TEAM
112,500,000 tokens will be allocated to the HOP team to support technical development, executive management, and partnerships. The tokens will unlock over 24 months after a 6-month cliff.

LIQUIDITY
32,500,000 tokens will be reserved to provide market liquidity to decentralized exchanges. The tokens will be instantly released upon TGE.

PRIVATE SALE
32,500,000 tokens will be reserved for a private sale. Information regarding the allocation of tokens towards public and private sales will be available at a future date. $HOP token is not an investment vehicle, and the HOP team cannot make any promises regarding future value.

PUBLIC SALE
93,750,000 tokens will be reserved for a public sale. Information regarding the allocation of tokens towards public and private sales will be available at a future date. $HOP token is not an investment vehicle, and the HOP team cannot make any promises regarding future value.


GAME ECONOMY

House of Power is a free-to-play game that provides an optional premium economic layer where players collect digital assets, receive higher gaming rewards, and access features that enhance the gaming experience. The game economy is sustained through natural cash flows that include fees from gaming-related activities as inflows and carefully balanced rewards from gaming and staking activities as outflows. 
The game economy can be broken into five modules that work together to create a circular and sustainable economy:

1.STAKEHOLDERS

2.EXCHANGE

3.BASE POOLS

4.INFLOW CHANNELS

5.OUTFLOW CHANNELS

Stakeholders

The two stakeholders in the HOP ecosystem are the community and HOP Foundation. All economic inflow activities originate from the community, and all economic outflow activities move into the community’s hands. HOP Foundation receives some of the inflow generated by the community as revenue streams. As always, 1 $HOP equals 1 $HOP.

Base Pools
The base pools contain tokens funded through either economic activities or a monetary policy and are fundamental in supporting DeFi mechanisms.

VAULT:
The Vault is a pool responsible for creating the buying pressure of the $HOP token and facilitating token rewards to stakers. The pool receives $EGLD through certain inflow channels. An automated and parametric system then facilitates the purchase of $HOP tokens on the open market to replenish the tokens held by the Staking Pool. While HOP will control the Vault and establish its structure at the start, the system is built in a way that enables a future transition to a fully-decentralized economy where users vote on decisions that will shape the game going forward.

Staking Rewards Pool: 
$HOP gets accumulated in the Staking Pool from the vault and is then distributed among all stakers in the system using the Staking Protocol. Users will be able to visualize their stake and anticipated rewards in a dynamic way.

Game Rewards Pool:  
The Game Rewards Pool contains tokens that reward players for participating in battles. Unlike the Vault and Staking Rewards Pool, tokens in this pool are assigned by the monetary policy. Gamers receive rewards according to their ranking and whether or not they own a Mobster NFT. Mobsters owners are eligible for the maximum rewards per battle, while free gamers receive rewards at a far smaller scale. 

Exchange

All $EGLD that gets accumulated in the Vault will eventually flow to the Staking Rewards Pool. However, since the pool only distributes staking rewards in $HOP, this requires $EGLD to be first exchanged to HOP’s native token. This process will ensure a consistent buying pressure of the $HOP token and will be one of the main drivers of the token’s stability

Inflow Channels 

The inflow channels are created from fee-based economic transactions that provide value to the community. The inflow of fees gets channeled to either the Vault or the HOP Foundation. Fees sent to the Vault eventually get distributed to stakers in the system as a reward for contributing to the network. In contrast, fees sent to the foundation are used for technical and executive development and represent the revenue streams for the HOP team.

HOP Foundation Inflows 

HOP Store: Mobsters Character NFT 
The HOP Store will offer the community new Mobsters NFT factions for sale in addition to the original Italian Factions NFTs. The new factions will come into play as the ecosystem and community grow. The original five factions only feature 2,000 characters, so the number will be expanded as the game matures.


Secondary Market 
Mobsters Card NFTs and Mobsters Character NFTs sold on secondary markets have royalty options of 10% built into the sales function on Deadrare and are planned with future layer-2 integrations across other marketplaces.

Vault Inflows 

HOP Store: Mobster Card Packs 
Mobster Card pack sales from the HOP Store are considered to be the primary Vault inflow. The packs are released in series, and each contains 5 NFT-based cards that can be common, rare, epic, or legendary. The NFTbased cards help players increase their odds of winning battles by having special abilities that create a strategically superior and robust deck. 

Crafting Stations 
Players can use Crafting Stations to improve their decks by generating new and better cards through crafting. Players interact with this process by inputting multiple undesirable duplicate cards, paying a fee, and receiving a rarer, more desirable card in return. The crafting fee gets sent to the Vault.

House of Power Factory 
Players can upgrade and customize their avatars through the HOP Factory by minting a Mobster Bod - a full-body extension of the avatar-based Mobster NFTs. Mob Bods visualize the humor and quirkiness of the Mobsters to the fullest. The Factory will expand into various other functions for players to build onto their characters and showcase them to others in the game. Premium upgrades and customizations carry a fee that gets sent to the Vault.

NFT Leasing 
NFT Leasing is an innovation on top of the ability to rent out NFTs and earn tokens. Mobsters NFT holders will have the option to lease out their assets to new players and share in the token rewards those players accumulate while playing the game for the agreed-upon lease contract duration. The lessee enters into a leasing contract with the lessor and receives full access to the game and the right to receive the maximum gaming rewards as any other Mob holder would. In turn, lessors earn the fee, with a small portion of that fee being sent to the Vault.

Outflow Channels

The outflow channels originate from the Game or Staking Reward Pools and are distributed to the community through the pools’ respective protocols. The community can receive these rewards by either playing the game or staking the $HOP token. The Gaming and Staking Protocols control the reward outflow in a way that maintains a balanced in-game economy and ensures enough incentive for particular groups of activities.

Staking Protocol 
Users can stake $HOP tokens in the staking platform and, in turn, receive rewards from the Staking Pool. Rewards are proportionally allocated to all stakers weekly. Eventually, this mechanism will morph into a governance system where stakers can vote on development decisions and influence the game’s future.

Gaming Protocol 
Users can earn $HOP tokens by engaging in battles in the trading card game. Rewards are allocated to both NFT and non-NFT owners, but players that own Mobster NFTs are guaranteed significantly higher rewards

$HOP Token:
$HOP are designed to be utilised, and that is the goal of the $HOP distribution. In fact, the project to develop House of Power would fail if all $HOP holders simply held onto their $HOP and did nothing with it. In particular, it is highlighted that $HOP:
(a)	does not have any tangible or physical manifestation, and does not have any intrinsic value (nor does any person make any representation or give any commitment as to its value);

(b)	is non-refundable and cannot be exchanged for cash (or its equivalent value in any other digital asset) or any payment obligation by the Company, the Distributor or any of their respective affiliates;

(c)	does not represent or confer on the token holder any right of any form with respect to the Company, the Distributor (or any of their respective affiliates), or its revenues or assets, including without limitation any right to receive future dividends, revenue, shares, ownership right or stake, share or security, any voting, distribution, redemption, liquidation, proprietary (including all forms of intellectual property or licence rights), right to receive accounts, financial statements or other financial data, the right to requisition or participate in shareholder meetings, the right to nominate a director, or other financial or legal rights or equivalent rights, or intellectual property rights or any other form of participation in or relating to House of Power, the Company, the Distributor and/or their service providers;

(d)	is not intended to represent any rights under a contract for differences or under any other contract the purpose or pretended purpose of which is to secure a profit or avoid a loss;

(e)	is not intended to be a representation of money (including electronic money), security, commodity, bond, debt instrument, unit in a collective investment scheme or any other kind of financial instrument or investment;
(f)	is not a loan to the Company, the Distributor or any of their respective affiliates, is not intended to represent a debt owed by the Company, the Distributor or any of their respective affiliates, and there is no expectation of profit; and(g)	does not provide the token holder with any ownership or other interest in the Company, the Distributor or any of their respective affiliates.

Notwithstanding the $HOP distribution, users have no economic or legal right over or beneficial interest in the assets of the Company, the Distributor, or any of their affiliates after the token distribution.

To the extent a secondary market or exchange for trading $HOP does develop, it would be run and operated wholly independently of the Company, the Distributor, the distribution of $HOP and House of Power. Neither the Company nor the Distributor will create such secondary markets nor will either entity act as an exchange for $HOP.
